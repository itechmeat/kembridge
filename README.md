# KEMBridge

## Cross-Chain Intelligence Meets Quantum Security

KEMBridge is an autonomous cross-chain bridge that enables secure asset transfers between different blockchains using post-quantum cryptography for protection against future quantum attacks. The project combines Near Protocol technologies (Chain Signatures, Shade Agents, 1Click API) with 1inch (Fusion+) to create a fully automated and AI-powered bridge.

## How It Works

KEMBridge uses post-quantum algorithms (primarily Kyber for key exchange) instead of traditional ECDSA cryptography. Through Near 1Click API, users can simply specify "exchange 1 ETH for NEAR with quantum protection" and the system automatically finds optimal routes through Market Maker competition, applies post-quantum cryptography, and executes the exchange with a single API call.

The system creates cryptographic proofs using lattice-based algorithms that are resistant to both classical and quantum computer attacks. Near Chain Signatures provide multi-chain functionality, allowing one smart contract on Near to manage assets across other blockchains.
