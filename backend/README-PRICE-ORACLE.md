# KEMBridge Price Oracle System

## Overview

The Price Oracle System is a comprehensive multi-provider price aggregation and validation service integrated into KEMBridge to provide accurate, real-time cryptocurrency pricing data for cross-chain bridge operations. It combines multiple data sources, intelligent aggregation algorithms, and robust caching strategies to ensure reliable price feeds for optimal swap execution.

## Architecture

The Price Oracle System consists of several interconnected components:

### 1. Multi-Provider Architecture (`/backend/src/price_oracle/providers/`)
- **Chainlink Provider**: Primary price feed source (development mock mode)
- **CoinGecko Provider**: Real-time market data integration with API key support
- **Binance Provider**: High-frequency trading data for major trading pairs
- **Provider Interface**: Unified trait-based interface for all price sources

### 2. Price Aggregation Engine (`/backend/src/price_oracle/aggregator.rs`)
- **Multiple Aggregation Methods**: WeightedAverage, MedianPrice, HighestConfidence, MostRecentPrice
- **Anomaly Filtering**: Statistical analysis to remove outlier price data
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quality assessment of aggregated price data
- **Variance Calculation**: Price deviation analysis across providers

### 3. Validation & Quality Control (`/backend/src/price_oracle/validator.rs`)
- **Basic Validation**: Price range checks, staleness detection, confidence thresholds
- **Advanced Validation**: Market-specific validation rules for different trading pairs
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical analysis using rolling averages and Z-scores
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic failover when validation failure rates exceed thresholds

### 4. Redis Caching Layer (`/backend/src/price_oracle/cache.rs`)
- **Primary Cache**: 60-second TTL for real-time price data
- **Fallback Cache**: 24-hour TTL for emergency price availability
- **Provider-Specific Caching**: Individual cache layers for each price provider
- **Quote Caching**: Short-term caching for swap quotes (30 seconds)

### 5. HTTP API Layer (`/backend/src/handlers/price_oracle.rs`)
- **Price Endpoints**: Individual and batch price retrieval
- **Quote Generation**: Swap quote calculation with price impact analysis
- **System Monitoring**: Provider health checks and cache statistics
- **Price Alerts**: User-configurable price alert system

## How It Works

### Price Aggregation Process

1. **Data Collection**: The system simultaneously queries multiple price providers:
   - **Chainlink**: Mock data for development, real contract calls for production
   - **CoinGecko**: REST API calls with rate limiting and API key support
   - **Binance**: High-frequency ticker data for major pairs (excludes NEAR)

2. **Validation Pipeline**: Each price data point passes through validation:
   - **Range Check**: Ensures prices fall within reasonable bounds per asset
   - **Staleness Check**: Verifies data freshness (max 5 minutes age)
   - **Confidence Check**: Validates provider-specific quality metrics
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical analysis to identify outliers

3. **Aggregation**: Valid price data is combined using configurable methods:
   - **Weighted Average**: Combines prices weighted by confidence scores
   - **Median Price**: Uses middle value to reduce impact of outliers
   - **Highest Confidence**: Selects price from most reliable source
   - **Most Recent**: Uses newest available price data

4. **Caching Strategy**: Processed data is cached with multiple TTL levels:
   - **Primary**: Short-term cache for active trading
   - **Fallback**: Long-term cache for system resilience
   - **Provider**: Individual caches for performance optimization

### Supported Trading Pairs

- **ETH/USD**: Ethereum to US Dollar
- **NEAR/USD**: NEAR Protocol to US Dollar  
- **BTC/USD**: Bitcoin to US Dollar
- **USDT/USD**: Tether to US Dollar
- **USDC/USD**: USD Coin to US Dollar

### Fallback Strategy

The system implements a multi-layered fallback approach:

1. **Chainlink Provider** (Primary)
2. **CoinGecko API** (Secondary)
3. **Binance API** (Tertiary)
4. **Redis Cache** (Fallback)
5. **Static Backup Prices** (Emergency)

## API Endpoints

### Price Retrieval
```
GET /api/v1/price/price?symbol=ETH/USD

```

### Quote Generation
```
POST /api/v1/price/quote

*These endpoints use Price Oracle for 1inch operation comparison and optimization*

## Configuration

### Provider Configuration
- **Chainlink**: Contract addresses and RPC endpoints
- **CoinGecko**: API keys and rate limiting settings
- **Binance**: Symbol mappings and connection parameters

### Validation Rules
- **Price Ranges**: Asset-specific minimum/maximum price bounds
- **Staleness Thresholds**: Maximum age for price data (default: 5 minutes)
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Minimum quality scores per provider
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical thresholds for outlier detection

### Cache Settings
- **Primary TTL**: 60 seconds for real-time data
- **Fallback TTL**: 24 hours for emergency availability
- **Provider TTL**: 30 seconds for individual source caching

### Dynamic Pricing Configuration
- **Bridge Base Fee**: 0.15% of transaction amount
- **Protocol Fee**: 0.10% of transaction amount
- **Slippage Protection Fee**: 0.05% of transaction amount
- **Gas Estimation**: 100,000 units at 20 gwei
- **Exchange Rate Weights**: 60% Oracle, 40% 1inch
